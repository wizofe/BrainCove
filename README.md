This repository contains source code that accompanies the paper "BrainCove: A tool for voxel-wise fMRI brain connectivity visualization" and thesis "Interactive Visualization of Functional Brain Connectivity". BrainCove is a prototype of an application for the interactive visualization of functional brain connectivity at voxel resolution. 

FubraConnex, the prototype tool for region-based functional brain connectivity can be found [here](https://code.google.com/p/fubraconnex "").

Background information
----------------------
Functional brain connectivity from fMRI studies has become an important tool in studying functional interactions in the human brain as a complex network. The correlation between the fMRI activity traces of distinct brain regions indicates to what extent they are functionally connected. fMRI connectivity data typically consists of a matrix of correlations, also denoted as functional correlations, either at the voxel level or averaged over anatomically defined brain regions using an anatomical template such as the Automated Anatomical Labeling (AAL).

Demo movie
----------
A demo movie can be downloaded [here](http://graphics.tudelft.nl/publications/dixhoorn_braincove_2012.mov "BrainCove demo movie").


How to build
------------
BrainCove can be easily built with CMake. Note: it has only been tested on Windows 7 (x64).

Please contact the author for test datasets.
